**Azure-End-to-End-Data-Engineering-Pipeline**
A fully automated data pipeline using Azure services to ingest, process, model, and visualize data sources

Overview Purpose: Ingest structured and unstructured data, cleanse and transform it using Databricks and Synapse, store it optimally, and visualize outcomes in Power BI.

Tech Stack: Azure Data Factory (ADF), Azure Databricks (PySpark + Delta Lake), Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Power BI.

Key Features: Fault-proof ETL design, schema refinement, partitioned data models, incremental load strategies, RBAC governance, and automated dashboards.

[Source Data] --> ADF Ingestion --> ADLS Gen2 (raw zone) |--> Databricks Transform --> ADLS Gen2 (curated zone) |--> Synapse (star schema) |--> Power BI (via Synapse & Gateway)

**#Pipeline Components**

ADF Pipelines Pipeline A: Ingests CSV/JSON/XML from REST/API or on-premises to ADLS raw zone.
Pipeline B: Triggers Databricks notebooks for transformation (data cleansing, delta writes).

Pipeline C: Loads curated data into Synapse dedicated pools using CTAS.

Databricks Notebooks Data Cleaning: Filter duplicates, normalize schema, handle nulls.
Transformation: Generate star-schema tables with lookup dims and fact tables.

Optimization: Use Delta Lake for ACID compliance and partition pruning.

Incremental Logic: Use MERGE operations for upserts based on watermark fields.

Synapse Data Warehouse Star Schema: Dimensions and facts optimized for analytics.
Partitioning & Indexing: Enabled on date-based columns for performance.

Stored Procedures: Used for maintenance (stats update, cleanup).

Power BI Layer Semantic model with composite relationships.
Measures in DAX for KPIs like volume, trends, YoY changes.

Automated daily refresh through Synapse–Power BI Gateway pipeline.

**Security & Governance** RBAC & ACLs: Configured at ADLS, Synapse, ADF, and workspace levels.

Parameterization: Use of environment variables and Key Vault secrets.

Auditing: ADLS Gen2 logs and pipeline run history tracking.

**How to Run Locally**

Clone repo.

Update config.json with your Azure details (resource names, secrets).

Deploy ADF ARM templates or use Azure CLI.

Run Databricks notebooks in development mode.

Validate schema in Synapse and run sample queries.

Connect Power BI file to Synapse server.

**Testing & Monitoring**

Unit tests: Built for Databricks using PyTest.

Data validation: Row-count and checksum checks in ADF–Databricks.

Alerts: Configured for pipeline failures, notebook errors, and slow-running queries via Azure Monitor.

Results & Insights Reduced pipeline runtime by 40% via parallelism and delta optimization.

Achieved 40% improvement in data freshness, supporting daily executive KPIs.

Enabled business teams to achieve insights 10x faster than previous manually-triggered scripts.

**Next Steps**

Extend to real-time ingestion using Event Hubs or IoT Hub.

Add dimension slowly changing dimension (SCD Type 2) logic in Databricks.

Expose API endpoints for analytics via Synapse serverless SQL.
